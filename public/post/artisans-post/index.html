<p>Alebrijes are spiritual guides that help us in our time of need. Each Alberije is hand-carved from Copal wood and later handpainted by Artisans from Oaxaca. This alebrije took 6 weeks to make.</p>

<p>Eduardo is one of the Master Artisans behind the alebrijes from the collective Del Copal Al Arte. Eduardo is Mixtec and was born in Oaxaca. He learned the art of creating alebrijes from his father, who also learned from his father, and so on. Eduardo has been creating alebrijes for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>Before an alebrije Eduardo imagined comes to life, first Eduardo carves the Copal wood. Then the wood is set to dry, a process which can take from 2 weeks to 1 month depending on size and the weather. When the wood is dry then it is treated to eliminate all kinds of plague. After this process is done Eduardo paints each alebrije and finally varnish it with a protective coat to protect the alebrije.</p>
